# Approved StealthBot Scripts
This is a collection of scripts approved by the StealthBot Development Team.

These scripts were made by well-known members of the community and have been approved by the development team. 

**We are not able to provide any support for these scripts**.

## Installation Instructions
**If the script is packaged as a ZIP**, simply extract the contents of the ZIP file to your StealthBot's "scripts" folder.
You can find this folder by clicking on the `Scripting` menu in StealthBot and choosing `Open Script Folder`.

**To install an unpackaged script**:
1. Open the script that you want to download.
2. Click on the "Raw" button.
3. Right click somewhere in the window with the script code and choose "Save as"
4. Save the script file (it should have a `.txt` or `.vbs` extension) to the `scripts` folder in your StealthBot's profile directory.
5. If the script you are downloading has any lines that start with `#include` at the top, you will need to download these files from the repository as well and place them in the same relative location.

**For both packaged and unpackaged scripts**: after installing the script files to your bot's folder you need to either restart your bot or go to the `Scripting` menu and choose `Reload Scripts`. 

## Deprecated Scripts
Scripts that are in the 'deprecated' folder are either confirmed to no longer be working, are very unlikely to work on any official server (due to server functionality being removed), or have had their functionality replaced.
